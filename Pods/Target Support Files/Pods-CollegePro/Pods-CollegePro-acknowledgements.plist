                     http://www.apache.org/licenses/
 
 
 
 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
 
 
 
 
1. Definitions.
 
 
 
 
   "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
 
   and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
 
 
 
 
   "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
 
   the copyright owner that is granting the License.
 
 
 
 
   "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
 
   other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
 
   control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
 
   "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
 
   direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
 
   otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
 
   outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
 
 
 
 
   "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
 
   exercising permissions granted by this License.
 
 
 
 
   "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
 
   including but not limited to software source code, documentation
 
   source, and configuration files.
 
 
 
 
   "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
 
   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
 
   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
 
   and conversions to other media types.
 
 
 
 
   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
 
   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
 
   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
 
   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
 
 
 
 
   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
 
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
 
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
 
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
 
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
 
   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
 
   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
 
 
 
 
   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
 
   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
 
   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
 
   submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
 
   or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
 
   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
 
   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
 
   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
 
   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
 
   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
 
   Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
 
   excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
 
   designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
 
 
 
 
   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
 
   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
 
   subsequently incorporated within the Work.
 
 
 
 
2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
 
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
 
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
 
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
 
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
 
 
 
 
3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
 
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
 
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
 
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
 
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
 
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
 
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
 
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
 
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
 
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
 
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
 
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
 
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
 
   as of the date such litigation is filed.
 
 
 
 
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
 
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
 
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
 
   meet the following conditions:
 
 
 
 
   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
 
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
 
 
 
 
   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
 
       stating that You changed the files; and
 
 
 
 
   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
 
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
 
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
 
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
 
       the Derivative Works; and
 
 
 
 
   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
 
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
 
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
 
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
 
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
 
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
 
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
 
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
 
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
 
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
 
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
 
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
 
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
 
       as modifying the License.
 
 
 
 
   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 
   the conditions stated in this License.
 
 
 
 
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
 
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
 
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
 
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 
 
 
 
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
 
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
 
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
 
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 
 
 
 
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
 
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
 
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
 
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
 
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
 
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
 
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 
 
 
 
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 
 
 
 
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
 
 
 
 
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 
 
 
 
APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
 
 
 
 
   To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
 
   boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
 
   replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
 
   the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate

no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare 
Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute 
the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
 
3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, 
each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, 
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent 
license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer 
the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such 
Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by 
combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was 
submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a 
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution 
incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, 
then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall 
terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
 
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative

License; and
 
b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You 
changed the files; and

all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of 
the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative 
Works; and
 
d) If the Work includes a “NOTICE” text file as part of its distribution, then any 
Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution 
notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain 
to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within 
a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source 
form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a 
display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices 
normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only 
and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within 
Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text 
from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed 
as modifying the License. 
 
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide 
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or 
distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, 
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with 
the conditions stated in this License. 
 
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution 
intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under 
the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. 
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any 
separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such 
Contributions.
 
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, 
service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and

“AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, 
including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, 
MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for 
determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks 
associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort 
(including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such

goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial 
damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such 
damages.

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
